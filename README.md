# Meme Coin Market Cap Index (MMC)

A decentralized index and allocation system for XRPL meme tokens with automated basket management.

---

## Project Overview

Meme Coin Market Cap Index (MMC) is a **DeFi-inspired system** built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that automatically manages a basket of meme tokens. The system:

- Allocates **75% of funds to a curated meme token basket**.
- Burns **10% of tokens** to create scarcity.
- Allocates **25% for operational and development costs**.
- Adjusts allocations automatically based on market activity and pre-defined rules.
- Provides transparency and efficiency for XRP holders interested in meme token exposure.

MMC celebrates the lore and community of XRPL meme tokens while providing a structured and automated way to engage with them.
